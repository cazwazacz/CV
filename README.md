## Allan Wazacz

I am a javascript and ruby developer looking for a role where I am challenged constantly to better myself and where I am working with people who I can learn from. Coming from a background in music, I find that there is a great overlap in what inspires me to do music and code. In both pursuits, one has tools and the free reign to create meaningful things that connect with people. Both also follow satisfyingly logical patterns. Programming allows me to challenge myself both logically - when coming up with a solution to a problem - and creatively - when figuring out an elegant solution to said problem. After discovering the immense satisfaction I could achieve from solving a problem with code, and the fact that this satisfaction could not be matched in any other way, I decided that this was the life for me.

#### Communication

People often come to me for help in code because I am good at breaking down concepts without being patronising which people tend to find helpful when I am explaining a pattern or debugging some code. I don’t take myself too seriously, but I can adapt quite well which has resulted in positive results when pair programming. I think people feel calm when I am coding with them because I don’t get outwardly frustrated and keep tensions low. This also works to my benefit when working in teams because I try to ensure that all members have a say in the direction that the project is taking to allow everyones needs to be met.

#### Self-learning

I am effective at rapidly picking up new technologies. This is fueled by my thirst for building new things using new-found knowledge. I started developing this skill before attending Makers Academy, but it was after attending that I really honed it. I am good at choosing specific materials to learn from, for example, I would rather read through some official documentation and pinpoint exactly the information I need as opposed to watching some tutorials which could have a lot of redundant information. An example of this in the Database Visualisation project, where on day one I got our project working with unfamiliar technologies just by reading documentation.
